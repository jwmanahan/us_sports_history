Ever wonder which football team is closest to a given place in the US, or which team people in St. Louis should root for now that the Rams left?
This gif is made to answer these questions and more!

Notes on methodology:
- If a team played home games in a given year, they get their color on the map
- If they were home in multiple stadiums, but one more than others, use the one with more
- If they were home in multiple staduims for similar number of games, take a point in between
- If two teams had the same home stadium, show as stripes in the joint area
- Team color was OP's choice, although effort was made to pick an official color and be consistent year to year
