Ever wonder which sports team is closest to a given place in the US, or which football team people in St. Louis should root for now that the Rams left?
This folder has the geographical images to answer these questions and more across a number of sports leagues and over time!

Notes on methodology:
- If a team played home games in a given year, they get their color on the map
- If they were home in multiple stadiums, but one more than others, use the one with more
- If they were home in multiple staduims for similar number of games, take a point in between
- If two teams had the same home stadium, they are shown with stripes in the joint area
- Team color was my choice, although effort was made to pick an official color and be consistent year to year
